::: notes
-   We should feel good about ourselves!

-   (appreciate the economical argument).

-   We literarlly founded the empirical investigation between brain and behaviour.

-   Think of all the empirically supported assessment tools.

-   We should position ourselves as developers even more!neuroscience, measurement, and human psychology are we positioning ourselves to be *producers*-- participating in and leading this edge of innovation?

-   AACN DTI Slide show

    -   We are the original tech innovators.

    -   not just about efficiency, its about changing the industry.

    -   AACN video is https://theaacn.org/disruptive-technology-initiative/introduction-karen-postal/

-   We believe education should break free from traditional silos and embrace coding, biotechnology, and engineering, among other fields. We believe there is opportunity for radical innovation in the measurement of brain function, cognition and behavior, and reimagining of how these data are analyzed, interpreted, and applied.

-   As neuropsychologists we are perfectly positioned to leverage strong scientific knowledge and research skills to produce market-disrupting technology and services. We understand the importance of economic value balanced with the clinical utility of our services and are devoted to the concepts of individual differences and diversity. Neuropsychologists developed ground-breaking tools to measure cognition and have used them to inform advances in medical and mental health diagnosis and care. We have clinics, research infrastructure andbusiness relationships that help position us for rapid technological innovation.

Neuropsychology as the original innovators of healthcare!

But who are the leaders within neuropsychology?

## Feedback

What came to everyone's minds?

1.  Are we **`Consumers`** or **`Producers`** of technology?

2.  What innovations have **`You`** been involved with?

3.  Which **`Colleagues`** do you look towards?

::: notes
-   Recently learnt about disruptive tech.

    -   New term for me!

-   Disruptive innovations = Innovations that make expensive or sophisticated products and services accessible and more affordable to a broader market.

-   **Disruptive innovation** refers to the use of technology that upsets a structure, as opposed to **"disruptive technology"**, which refers to the technology itself.

-   Disruptive Technology refers to changes and innovations in a sector that are so profound they alter the way service is rendered or performed--*disrupting* the old market, and creating an entirely new market, with significant societal impact. Some examples of disruptive technology are the smartphone, digital photography, and companies such as Amazon, Tesla, Uber, and AirBnB.

# Case Study:<br>Problem Definition {background-color="#01364C" style="font-size: 35px; text-align: left;"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Motivation

1.  Converting test scores to a single metric.

2.  Tabulating test scores.

3.  Visualising test scores.

These are all **very useful** practices however they are labour some, clunky, and error prone.

:arrow_right: **`Score Converter`** is an attempt to overcome some of these points

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Conversions

-   There are many types of standardised score[^2].

-   There is value in working with a unified metric[^3].

-   Two primary approaches `Look-Up Tables` and Manual Conversions (`Formulas`).

[^2]: $Z$ Score, $T$ Score, Wechsler Standard Score, Wechsler Scaled Score, Sten Score, Stanine Score, Vineland Scaled Score, ETS Score, etc.

[^3]: Crawford (2010) in Goldestein (2010) Clinical Neuropsychology: A Practical Guide to Assessment and Management for Clinicians, 2nd Edition

::: notes
-   Important for reports, communication, and interpretation.

-   Descriptors are useful but also problematic.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Problems with Look-Up Tables**

-   $Z$ score of 1.7 to a standard score.
-   Standard scores 126, and 127, to $T$ scores.
-   Percentile rank of 87 to a scaled score.

For a full version of a traditional look-up table click [here](https://guardianadlitem.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Psychometric-Conversion-Table.pdf).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)

data.frame(
  standard.score = 90:110,
  rank = c(25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 37, 40, 42, 45, 47, 50, 53, 55, 58, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 73, 75),
  scaled.score = c(8, NA, NA, NA, NA, 9, NA, NA, NA, NA, 10, NA, NA, NA, NA, 11, NA, NA, NA, NA, 12),
  t.score = c(43, NA, NA, 45, NA, 47, NA, NA, 48, NA, 50, NA, 52, NA, NA, 53, NA, NA, 55, NA, 57),
  z.score = c(-0.67, NA, NA, -0.5, NA, -0.33, NA, NA, -0.25, NA, 0.00, NA, 0.25, NA, NA, 0.33, NA, NA, 0.55, NA, 0.67),
  sten.score = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 5, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 6, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)) %>%
  arrange(desc(standard.score)) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names("title") %>%
  gt() %>%
  opt_table_lines(extent = "none") %>%
  tab_options(heading.border.bottom.width = 2,
              heading.border.bottom.color = "black",
              heading.border.bottom.style = "solid",
              table.border.top.color = "white",
              table_body.hlines.color = "white",
              table_body.border.top.color = "black",
              table_body.border.top.style = "solid",
              table_body.border.top.width = 1,
              heading.title.font.size = 12,
              table.font.size = 12,
              heading.subtitle.font.size = 12,
              table_body.border.bottom.color = "black",
              table_body.border.bottom.width = 1,
              table_body.border.bottom.style = "solid",
              column_labels.border.bottom.color = "black",
              column_labels.border.bottom.style = "solid",
              column_labels.border.bottom.width = 1,
              column_labels.border.top.color = "black",
              column_labels.border.top.style = "solid",
              column_labels.border.top.width = 1,
              column_labels.font.weight = "bold"
              ) %>%
  opt_table_font(font = "times") %>%
  cols_align(columns = 1:6, align = "center") %>%
  opt_row_striping(row_striping = T) %>% 
  gt::sub_missing()
```

## **Considerations**

-   Decimal places and rounding can influence precision.
-   Increment length can influence precision.
-   The best metric to use is likely to vary based on the purpose for use.

**Summary:** `Look-Up` tables can be problematic.

An alternative approach is to use a `Formula`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$
X_{new} =
\frac{s_{new}}{s_{old}}
(X_{old} - \bar{X}_{old})
+ \bar{X}_{new}
$$

**However** this can be

-   Timely
-   Complicated
-   Error prone

> **`Problem 1:`** <br>Need to be able to efficiently and precisely convert scores to a single metric, while also being able to flexibly change metric depending upon the audience.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Tabulation

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Table of results are really important.
-   don't always report the required information.
-   Often look ugly and cumbersome.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Commonly Incurred Problems:**

-   Not clear which metric.
-   Not clear which test, test version or test form.
-   Not clear which normative data.
-   Not clear which formula (e.g., reliable change).
-   No confidence intervals.
-   Poor formatting, cumberosme.
:::
:::

> **`Problem 2:`**<br> Need to be able to easily construct a table of results that is clearly formatted, intuitive, and promotes good reporting practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Visualisation

Data Visualisation is a really important tool for interpreting data.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Who doesn't like a nice graph?
-   More than just aesthetics!
    -   New insights (e.g., trends)
    -   Speeds up assimilation.
    -   Communication
-   Rarely used in practice?

> **`Problem 3:`**<br> Need to be able to easily visualise a range of test scores in a way that is intuitive for a variety of audiences.
